<p>Before installing iHRIS Manage, spend some time collecting data about your organization and its employees. This will enable set up of the necessary data structure for entering data into the system. This section gives guidance on the data that should be collected and provides checklists for recording and organizing the data. 
</p><p>There are four checklists to complete to set up iHRIS Manage: 
</p>
<ul><li> Data Setup Checklist
</li></ul><ul><li> Define Geographical Locations
</li></ul><ul><li> Define a Job Structure
</li></ul><ul><li> Set Up Current Positions and Employees
</li></ul><p>If your organization offers in-service trainings to employees, you may also choose to set up a training program in iHRIS Manage. This module is optional.

<a name="Identification_types" id="Identification_types"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Identification types </span></h3>
<p><i>Identification types</i> are non-changing IDs, such as a Social Security Number, driver's license, passport or national health insurance card, that are used to identify an employee. Identification numbers are entered into the system when a job applicant completes an application and when an employee is hired. The types of identification that are required depend on the laws of your country and the policies of your organization. 
</p><p>List all identification types that will need to be tracked.

</p><p><br /></p>
<a name="Define_Geographical_Locations" id="Define_Geographical_Locations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Define Geographical Locations </span></h2>
<p>iHRIS Manage can track human resources data by four types of geographical locations. The system reports aggregate data at each level in order to analyze human resources at the national, regional, district and/or county level. 
</p><p><a class="image" title="Image:Geographical_locations.jpg"><img alt="Image:Geographical_locations.jpg" src="geographical_locations.jpg" width="625" height="439" border="0" /></a>
</p><p>When data with a geographical component is entered in the system, such as an employee's home address or the location of an office or facility, you are first prompted to select a country. The system then displays a list of regions within that country for selection. After selecting a region, the system displays a list of districts within that region, as well as any counties that may have been entered for the district. Choosing the district is required; choosing a county is not, but is useful for tracking data by the smallest geographical subset. 
</p><p>Each office or facility in the organization is linked to a district and, optionally, a county. Each office or facility is assigned a type, which defines the category it belongs in (such as office, hospital or clinic). Positions can then be defined for each office/facility. 
</p><p><br /></p>
<a name="Locations_Worksheet" id="Locations_Worksheet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Locations Worksheet </span></h3>
<p>Complete the following exercise for each country where employees are located. This will determine the geographical and office/facility data that need to be entered into the system. This exercise should be completed by an HR Manager. 
</p><p><b>Country name: </b>
</p><p><b>Currency (for employee salaries):</b> 
</p><p><b>Region names:</b> 
</p><p><i>If you are not tracking data by region, enter one country-wide region, such as "National."</i> 
</p><p><b>District/state/province names for each region:</b> 
</p><p><b>County/sector names for each district/state/province (optional):</b> 
</p><p><b>Offices/facilities in the country and type of facility:</b>
</p><p><b>Departments used by the office/facility or by the organization as a whole (optional): </b> 
</p><p><br /></p>
<a name="Example_Scenarios" id="Example_Scenarios"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Example Scenarios </span></h3>
<p>The following examples illustrate several scenarios for setting up geographical locations and offices/facilities in the system, depending on your organization's locations and needs. 
</p><p><b>1) The organization has one office and does not track data regionally.</b> 
</p><p>Create a country with the name of the country where the office is located. For that country, enter any meaningful name to signify the one required region, such as "National." For that region, enter the name of the district, state or province where the office is located. For that district, enter the name of the county or sector where the office is located (optional). Enter one facility type, such as "office," to categorize the office. Create an office and enter a meaningful name for the office, such as "Headquarters." Link it to the country, district and county entered. 
</p><p><b>2) The organization has several offices or facilities in one country and needs to track data regionally.</b> 
</p><p>Create a country with the name of the country where the offices/facilities are located. Enter the names of the regions where the offices/facilities are located, or all regions in the country. Enter the names of the districts, states or provinces within each region where the offices/facilities are located, or all districts in the country. Enter the names of the counties or sectors within each district where the offices/facilities are located, or all counties in the country (optional). Enter the names of all offices or facilities, assigned to their specific district and county locations, and categorized by the specific facility types you have defined. 
</p><p><b>3) The organization has several offices or facilities in several countries and may need to track data regionally for some.</b> 
</p><p>Create all countries where offices/facilities are located. For each country where regional data should be tracked, enter the names of the regions within that country. For each country where regional data does not need to be tracked, enter one "region," such as "National." For each defined region, enter the name of at least one district, state or province. Enter the names of counties or sectors within defined districts (optional). Enter the names of all offices or facilities, assigned to their specific country, district and county locations, and categorized by the specific facility types you have defined. 
</p><p><b>4) The organization has only office but has personnel assigned to work in several different geographical locations.</b> 
</p><p>Create all countries where employees are located. For each country, enter the name of at least one region; if regional data does need to be tracked, enter a meaningful name for one region per country, such as "National." For each region, enter the names of all districts, states or provinces where employees are located. Enter the name of counties or sectors where employees are located within defined districts (optional). Configure the system to globally turn off the offices/facilities feature; all positions will be linked to a geographical location instead. (Requires customization by a programmer.) 
</p><p><b>Actions:</b> When you have completed this worksheet, enter into the system, in the following order: 
</p>
<ul><li> all countries identified -- at least one must be entered (see <a href="ihris_add_geographical_areas.html#Add_a_Country" title="Add Geographical Areas" class="mw-redirect">Add a country</a>)

</li></ul><p><br /></p>
<a name="Define_a_Job_Structure" id="Define_a_Job_Structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Define a Job Structure </span></h2>
<p>In iHRIS Manage, a <i>job</i> is defined as a general set of qualifications, duties and responsibilities that one person performs in the organization. Each job has a title, code and description. 
</p><p>A job may be categorized by any of the following: 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Cadre:</b> a category of health professionals who work for the organization 
</li></ul><ul><li> <b>Job classification:</b> a standard job category and code that may or may not include health professionals 
</li></ul><ul><li> <b>Salary grade:</b> a grade of pay for a job 
</li></ul><p>All of these categorizations are optional. They are intended to organize jobs and track and report on data in ways that are meaningful for your organization. 
</p><p>There may be multiple instances of the same job. Each instance, which is filled by a single employee performing that job function, is called a position. The position may have the same title as the job, or it may have an additional position title. 
</p><p>Positions may be: 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Open:</b> No employee currently holds the position, and the organization is actively accepting applications or seeking to hire into the position. 
</li></ul><ul><li> <b>Closed:</b> An employee currently holds the position. 
</li></ul><ul><li> <b>Discontinued:</b> No employee currently holds the position, and the organization is not seeking to hire into the position, but the position may be reopened at some later date 
</li></ul><p>Each position has one spot on the organizational chart and one supervisor. Each position is located at a particular office or facility. Each position may optionally be assigned a code, department and position type (such as permanent, temporary or part-time).
</p><p>The following chart illustrates how job data are related in the system: 
</p><p><a class="image" title="Image:Job_structure_generic.jpg"><img alt="Image:Job_structure_generic.jpg" src="job_structure_generic.jpg" width="625" height="367" border="0" /></a>
