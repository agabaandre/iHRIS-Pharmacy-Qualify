<p>Before installing iHRIS Qualify, spend some time thinking about what kinds of data you would like to collect on health workers during the training, registration and licensing process. Existing paper forms can be helpful in assembling this information. This will enable setup of the necessary data structure for entering data into the system. This section gives guidance on the data that should be collected and provides checklists for recording and organizing the data. 
</p><p>There are three checklists to complete to set up iHRIS Qualify:

<a name="Define_Geographical_Locations" id="Define_Geographical_Locations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Define Geographical Locations </span></h2>
<p>iHRIS Qualify can track health workforce data by four types of geographical locations. The system reports aggregate data at each level in order to analyze human resources at the national, regional, district and/or county level. 
</p><p><br /><a class="image" title="File:Geographical_locations.jpg"><img alt="File:Geographical_locations.jpg" src="geographical_locations.jpg" width="625" height="439" border="0" /></a>
</p><p><br />
When data with a geographical component is entered in the system, such as an employee's home address or the location of an office or facility, you are first prompted to select a country. The system then displays a list of districts within that country for selection. (The region is automatically determined by the district that is selected.) After selecting a district, the system displays a list of counties within that district. Choosing the district is required; choosing a county is not, but is useful for tracking data by the smallest geographical subset. 
</p><p>Each training institution or health facility in the organization is linked to a district and, optionally, a county. Each training institution or health facility is assigned a facility agent, which defines its owner or classification, such as government, mission or private. 
</p><p><br /></p>
<a name="Locations_Worksheet" id="Locations_Worksheet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Locations Worksheet </span></h3>
<p>Complete the following exercise for each country where employees are located. This will determine the geographical and office/facility data that need to be entered into the system. This exercise should be completed by a Data Operations Manager. 
</p><p><b>Country name:</b> 
</p><p><b>Region names:</b> 
</p><p>If you are not tracking data by region, enter one country-wide region, such as "National." 
</p><p><b>District/state/province names for each region:</b> 
</p><p><b>County/sector names for each district/state/province (optional):</b> 
</p><p><b>Actions:</b> When you have completed this worksheet, enter into the system, in the following order: 
</p>
<ul><li> all countries identified -- at least one must be entered (see Add a Country)
</li></ul><ul><li> all regions identified for each country -- at least one region per country (see Add a Region) 
</li></ul><ul><li> all districts identified for each region -- at least one district per region (see Add a District) 
</li></ul><ul><li> all counties identified for each district -- optional (see Add a County) 
</li></ul><p><br /></p>
<a name="Health_Worker_Data_Checklist" id="Health_Worker_Data_Checklist"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Health Worker Data Checklist </span></h2>
<p>When you first start to use iHRIS Qualify, you may have a backlog of health worker records to enter in the system. It is helpful to gather as much information as possible before beginning this backlog data entry. Training institution records, examination applications and results, registration applications, license applications and other documents will all be helpful to building a complete picture of the health workforce.
</p><p>The first step is to decide what information about health workers you want to track. While iHRIS Qualify is designed to record a complete record of the health worker from the time s/he enters training until the time s/he leaves the workforce, not all of that information is required by the system. Plan to collect and enter only the data you need to answer your most pressing questions about the health workforce in your country.
</p><p>The following checklist will help you determine which health workforce data you should track. Check off each item that you need to enter to have a complete record for each health worker. 
</p><p><br /></p>
<a name="General_information" id="General_information"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> General information </span></h3>

<a name="Training_information" id="Training_information"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Training information </span></h3>
<p>Required:

</p><p>__ Date and reason for any training disruptions
</p><p>__ Date for any resumptions in training upgrade
</p><p><b>Notes:</b> 
</p><p>A training may be received inside or outside the country.
</p><p>Selecting the cadre for a training associates the health worker with the cadre in which s/he is qualified to practice. Recording a graduation date, or end date, for the training makes the health worker eligible for registration. The system will not permit the registration to be issued unless the end date is recorded.
</p><p>When a new training is recorded for a health worker, a unique index, or identification, number is generated by the system for that training alone if it is not typed in. The index number is used only to identify the training program and may be issued by the training institution. Index numbers should be unique, especially within the same cadre.
</p><p>When a person receives a subsequent training in a cadre other than the one s/he initially registered in, the person has received an . If the training is received in-country, the upgrade should not be in the same cadre in which the person has previously been trained. However, the person can receive upgrades for the same cadre when trained outside the country.

</p><p>The registration number is the health worker's main identification number within iHRIS Qualify. It must be unique. It can be reused for all licenses and license renewals.
</p><p>The registration number is linked to the cadre in which the person is qualified to practice. If a health worker receives more than one registration in multiple cadres, a new registration number is issued for each subsequent registration.
