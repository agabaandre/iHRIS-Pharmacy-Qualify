<p>Before a registration or license can be issued for a health worker, the pre-service training program that the health worker completed to become qualified to practice in that cadre must be recorded. The training program information can be recorded when the student enters school, while the program is in progress or after it has been completed, and it may have been completed inside or outside the country. Each training receives a unique index number used to identify a student in a training program in a particular cadre. The index number may be issued by the training institution. A health worker can complete multiple training programs; each additional program is called an upgrade and qualifies the health worker to practice in another cadre.
