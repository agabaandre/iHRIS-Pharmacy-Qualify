    get report view name, report name and relationship name for
    a custom report display 4301: Luke Duncan 2016-03-11 Added in
    transaction for process_saves on the relationship queue so that
    if one form fails to validate none will get saved and it rolls
    back so the XML can be corrected and re-imported without issue.
    Otherwise the top level form may be saved but some child forms or
    mapped forms may not be there.  4300: Launchpad Translations on

    in a relationship instead of just the top level.  4295: Luke Duncan
    2016-02-29 Fixed fuzzy method set up for checkLimit_null_not_null
    as well.  4294: Luke Duncan 2016-02-29 Fix fuzzy method called
    for generateLimit_null_not_null to be the correct method isntead
    of always not null.  Modified null_not_null template to allow a
    blank option so it can be turned off as a limit when not needed.
    Also changed text display to be clear on what is being chosen
    for 'Null' or 'Not Null'.  4293: Ally Shaban 2016-02-26 Fixed
    syntax error 4292: Luke Duncan 2016-02-24 Modified form field
    processDOM to not copy over every attribute so there aren't issues
    with later modules that may modify the DOM (specificaly display
    with the Tags module).  4291: Launchpad Translations on behalf of

    Luke Duncan 2016-02-11 Added in option for limiting the number

    4286: Luke Duncan 2016-02-10 Added in option to use display reports
    for web services lists.  This will allow better limiting of top
    level values when nothing can be selected below them.  For an
    example of use, see the ManageFacilityTree module in iHRIS Manage.

    breaking cached forms updates.  4283: Luke Duncan 2016-02-02
    Added in variable definition to avoid type error.  4282: Luke

    2016-01-28 Put in a hack to make TIME() work with the datetime
    value starts with 0000-00-00.  In MySQL TIME() returns null on
    a datetime field that starts with 0s but it works when it's
    a string.  DATE() works fine in both cases.  4277: Launchpad

    Luke Duncan 2015-12-11 Modified default options for gizmo form
    to not skip i2ce_hidden in the display, added it back in to skip
    by default on the view page (when is_edit is false) so it's only
    there on the edit page.  4273: Luke Duncan 2015-12-11 Fixed link
    for the show hidden/non-hidden/all menu on the auto list page.

    automatic translations update.  4269: Launchpad Translations on

    translations update.  4268: Luke Duncan 2015-11-10 Updated Swiss
    SQLFunction getFieldObj method to include the relationship so
    it can be passed through to web services lists to determine all
    the details for displaying the field for limits.  Modified web
    services lists to take this information to determine the correct
    field object to use for display.  Added in field options for the
    getFunctionDetails for I2CE_FormRelationship similar to what
    is used for SQLFunction->getFieldObj.  Also fixed issue with
    limits when now form field was being used for web services lists.
    4267: Luke Duncan 2015-11-09 Updated web services lists to work
    better with forms that refer to the same form limited by a field.
    Also allowed the different limits set by the display string to be
    used in this case.  4266: Luke Duncan 2015-11-09 Also removed new
    link when the form isn't writable for auto list pages.  4265: Luke
    Duncan 2015-11-09 Added option to display totals for configured
    columns for ODT printed reports.  Pulled from 4.1-dev.  4264:
    Luke Duncan 2015-11-09 Changed modified.value comparison for
    magic data form storage to include STR_TO_DATE to avoid errors in
    some versions of MySQL.  4263: Launchpad Translations on behalf of
    intrahealth+informatics 2015-10-31 Launchpad automatic translations
    update.  4262: Luke Duncan 2015-10-27 Changed paginateList
    calls to use the jumper_id of select_list as that is what is in
    the template so paging shows up on auto list pages.  4261: Carl

    XML DB form storage now supports the faster caching by creating a
    subselect of values UNION'ed together 4258: Carl Leitner 2015-10-25
    Cached forms and form storage for non-DB like form storage
    mechanisms can support a faster (than slow) insert.  the form
    storage mechanism needs to create a sub-select query for an insert
    statement that looks something like (select 1 as id, 'A1' as code
    union 2, 'A2') 4257: Carl Leitner 2015-10-25 better error checking
