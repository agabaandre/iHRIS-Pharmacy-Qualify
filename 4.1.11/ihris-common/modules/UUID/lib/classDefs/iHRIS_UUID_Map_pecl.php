     * Version 1 UUIDs are guaranteed to be unique through combinations of hardware addresses, time stamps and random seeds. There is a reference in the UUID to the hardware (MAC) address of the first network interface card (NIC) on the host which generated the UUID this reference is intended to ensure the UUID will be unique in space as the MAC address of every network card is assigned by a single global authority (IEEE) and is guaranteed to be unique. The next component in a UUID is a timestamp which, as clock always (should) move forward, will be unique in time. Just in case some part of the above goes wrong (the hardware address cannot be determined or the clock moved steps backward), there is a random clock sequence component placed into the UUID as a catch-all for uniqueness.
     * <br/>
     * Version 3 and version 5 UUIDs are guaranteed to be inherently globally unique if the combination of namespace and name used to generate them is unique.  It is  not supported at the moment
     * <br/>
     * Version 4 UUIDs are not guaranteed to be globally unique, because they are generated out of locally gathered pseudo-random numbers only. Nevertheless there is still a high likelihood of uniqueness over space and time and that they are computationally difficult to guess. 
     *                                                                                                *
